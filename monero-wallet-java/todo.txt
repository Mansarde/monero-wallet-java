sendFromAddresses() then replicate in sendSplit
check for unrecognized fields

get_output_distribution distribution field cannot be deserialized to array of integer
investigate do not relay, way of doing pending transaction?  would need to relay 
get rid of individual getBalance(), getUnlockedBalance(), isMultisigImportNeeded() and replace with getAccount() with all info?
why is transaction amount 0 when destinations present
why don't some transactions have destinations

Monero-wallet-rpc suggested improvements:
address book entries work by index instead of id which changes
optional param documentation missing
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology destinations vs outputs vs payments (I like payment which is address + amount)
consistently return all possible fields
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
why doesn't tx_size get returned on get_transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
no way to get transaction keys after sending
height vs block_height inconsistent
key is never returned as part of get transactions and their variations
