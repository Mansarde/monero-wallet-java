v0.12.3.0
investigate do not relay, way of doing pending transaction?  would need to relay
get rid of individual getBalance(), getUnlockedBalance(), isMultisigImportNeeded() and replace with getAccount() with all info?
why is transaction amount 0 when destinations present
why don't some transactions have destinations
what is an amount key?
test MoneroUtils.newAddress() used by wallet.send(str,str)

Monero-wallet-rpc suggested improvements:
below_amount - unsigned int; (Optional) Include outputs below this amount. - shouldn't it be above?
getbalance subaddress should be array
get_transfers each group has double_spend_seen
optional param documentation missing
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology destinations vs outputs vs payments (I like payment which is address + amount)
consistently return all possible fields
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
why doesn't tx_size get returned on get_transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
no way to get transaction keys after sending
height vs block_height inconsistent
key is never returned as part of get transactions and their variations
