v0.12.3.0
what is an amount key?
test MoneroUtils.newAddress() used by wallet.send(str,str)

Monero-wallet-rpc suggested improvements:
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology destinations vs outputs vs payments (I like payment which is address + amount)
consistently return all possible fields
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
why doesn't tx_size get returned on get_transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
no way to get transaction keys after sending
height vs block_height inconsistent
key is never returned as part of get transactions and their variations
