v0.12.3.0
test right after sending that get_transfers with sent id returns destinations
test getTxs() with outgoing payments because fetched by id
test that subaddress numUnspentOutputs == incoming transfers unspent payments
belowAmount only supported in sweep?  assert not used when not usable
outbound transactions do not relable record minor, e.g. send from [2,3] but tx minor will be 0
monerotx should only have one id
merge based on subaddress location
sendFromMultiple() searches for account

test pool
test getTxs() by account
test getTxs() with txIds filter
test reads with specific accounts / subaddresses
check for unrecognized fields
sendToMultiple fans out across more accounts, then send tests search for account which meets requirements

get_output_distribution distribution field cannot be deserialized to array of integer
investigate do not relay, way of doing pending transaction?  would need to relay 
get rid of individual getBalance(), getUnlockedBalance(), isMultisigImportNeeded() and replace with getAccount() with all info?
why is transaction amount 0 when destinations present
why don't some transactions have destinations

Monero-wallet-rpc suggested improvements:
get_transfers defaults [0, 0], incoming_transfers defaults [0, all], get_bulk_payments defaults [all, all]
sending from account 1 says has unlocked balance but get -16 tx not possible.  Fixes itself after confirmations
it needs to be documented that rescan_bc destroys wallet cache (destination addresses, etc)
incoming_transfers d59fe775249465621d7736b53c0cb488e03e4da8dae647a13492ea51d7685c62 totalAmount is 0?
outgoing destinations only known after first confirmation
tx_size only known in incoming_transfers
timestamps can vary across txs (see txid faa8a4aecb4de18c91dcedb00be76f4f9d3d79839b5bf9cab87f2e3632fc574c)
get_transfer_by_txid only returns incoming, not outgoing counterpart
add address to incoming_transfers
add tx_size to get_transfer_by_txid
fee is included on incoming transactions from get_transfers but it is not in incoming_transfers; with incoming account 0 bug cannot reliably get fee
get_transfers of account 0 all subaddresses does not return incoming transfers!
monero-wallet-rpc outgoing transactions do not indicate originating subaddresses
must call get_transfer_by_txid in order to get outgoing destinations
address book entries work by index instead of id which changes
optional param documentation missing
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology destinations vs outputs vs payments (I like payment which is address + amount)
consistently return all possible fields
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
why doesn't tx_size get returned on get_transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
no way to get transaction keys after sending
height vs block_height inconsistent
key is never returned as part of get transactions and their variations
