v0.13.0
new api calls
payments are comprised of outputs
don't call accounts / subaddresses that are unused
test getTxs() with outgoing payments because fetched by id
test that subaddress numUnspentOutputs == incoming transfers unspent payments
test right after sending that get_transfers with sent id returns destinations
multisig support and tests
get_output_distribution distribution field cannot be deserialized to array of integer
belowAmount only supported in sweep?  assert not used when not usable
outbound transactions do not relable record minor, e.g. send from [2,3] but tx minor will be 0
optimize (cache subaddresses, check if used, etc)
generate javadoc
update readme

MONERO-RPC SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
seeing invalid params on testSEndSplitFromMultiple() when unlocked is too low; pull from accounts with min balance and better error code when unlocked is too low
don't return incorrect balance information if multisig, instead return error
incoming_transfers add address, fee, timestamp, unlock_time, is_double_spend, height
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
get_transfers defaults [0, 0], incoming_transfers defaults [0, all], get_bulk_payments defaults [all, all]
document that rescan_bc destroys wallet cache (destination addresses, etc)
height vs block_height inconsistent
address book entries work by index instead of id which changes
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
